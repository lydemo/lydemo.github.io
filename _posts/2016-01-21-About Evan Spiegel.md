The following question is interesting,since I have never found similar question in Zhihu,it is a question about Evan Spiegel,one of the richest man born in 1990,in Quora:

### Q:Why does Evan Spiegel own snapchat if he doesn't know programming?

A:Evan Spiegel is just one shareholder (although a very big one), and programming is just one of the important skills in a software technology business.

The best way to answer your question is to also answer some related questions...

[Can Evan Spiegel, a Stanford dropout and co-founder & CEO of Snapchat, write code?](https://www.quora.com/Evan-Spiegel-1/Can-Evan-Spiegel-a-Stanford-dropout-and-co-founder-CEO-of-Snapchat-write-code)

He can, but this is far from the most important skill for a CEO. Strategy, design, marketing, attracting investment and high-level selling are much more important skills with this role.

[How did Evan Spiegel create Snapchat, knowing he studied product design which has nothing to do with coding?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Evan-Spiegel-create-Snapchat-knowing-he-studied-product-design-which-has-nothing-to-do-with-coding)

Because product design is a key part of creating a successful product.

[How is Snapchat's CEO and co-founder Evan Spiegel worth $210 Million when Snapchat doesn't make money?](https://www.quora.com/How-is-Snapchats-CEO-and-co-founder-Evan-Spiegel-worth-210-Million-when-Snapchat-doesnt-make-money)

Because many well capitalised ventures focus on acquiring/retaining users and building their product into people's daily lives, in the belief that this will lead to a sustainable and profitable business.

So the total answer is to understand that programming is an important skill in a software-based business, but even for a programmer, it is only one of the relevant skills. Understand the customer, understand their use case, and design for how your user will use your product every day... then you can build a successful product.

Obviously these questions are put by Chinese,OK,just for fun...
